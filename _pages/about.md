Fareeda is a postgraduate research student, whose work focuses on violence against peacekeepers, rebel strategies, and gender dynamics in African conflicts. She holds an MSc in Conflict Resolution (with Distinction) from the University of Essex, where her dissertation was on Challenging the Peace: Examining Drivers of Rebel Violence Against Peacekeepers, and a BSc in Political Science (statistics minor) with high honors from Cairo University. 

Her overall research interests include gender and armed conflict, public policy, migration and citizenship, and analysis of conflict management using quantitative methods. Fareeda's doctoral research is funded by a Faculty of Social Sciences Partnership Research PhD Scholarship, in partnership with Action on Armed Violence (AOAV).

Prior to starting her PhD studies in October 2023, Fareeda had been working at the Cairo International Center for Conflict Resolution, Peacekeeping, and Peacebuilding (CCCPA) for two years, where she led the peacemaking and peacebuilding program. In this capacity, she was responsible for planning yearly activities, drafting funding proposals, conducting and publishing research on relevant thematic areas, and designing content for tailored capacity building trainings and convening workshops, often in partnership with relevant stakeholders, including the United Nations and African Union. Fareeda was also seconded to the International Organization for Migration (IOM) Mission in Juba, South Sudan for 3 months.
